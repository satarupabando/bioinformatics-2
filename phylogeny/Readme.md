# Overview

This is a small project from the class *Fundamental Models and ALgorithms in Bioinformatics*.

In this project, I chose three genes that I am interested:

1. BRCA1, a gene involves in DNA repair. Mutations in this BRCA1 correlates with high chance of breast cancer.
2. Foxp2,  a key gene involves in learning language. It has beed demonstrated that key mutations in human Foxp2 lead to its expanded function compared to Foxp2 in Chimpanzee.
3. Cpeb3, a key genen that involves in memory storage. 

The Foxp2, Cpeb3 genes are key in human intelligence development. Thus, I would like to see the phylogenic tree of these genes across the mammalians.

The information of genes in different mammals were downloaded form *orthodb.org*.
