ML-NNI round 1: LogLk = -9489.927 NNIs 40 max delta 11.22 Time 4.73
Switched to using 20 rate categories (CAT approximation)
Rate categories were divided by 0.792 so that average rate = 1.0
CAT-based log-likelihoods may not be comparable across runs
Use -gamma for approximate but comparable Gamma(20) log-likelihoods
