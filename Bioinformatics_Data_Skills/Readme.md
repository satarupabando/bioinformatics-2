# Bioinformatics Data Skills

I went through all the examples and practice in *Bioinformatics Data Skills* by Vine Buffalo including working with sequence data, range data, alignment data and shell scripting etc.

Here, I used the jupyter notebook as the demonstration of all the practice and examples since the organization of jupyter notebook is much better suited for annotations and experimenting. 

Overall, this is a great entry to mid level introduction of all the commonly used bioinformatics data skills. From working with different data types, shell scripting, Git, Tabix, SQLite to organizing projects and so on, this books cover a lot of practical aspects that courses do not.

Great book.
