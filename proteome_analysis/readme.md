## Overview
**Context:** This dataset contains published iTRAQ proteome profiling of 77 breast cancer samples generated by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (NCI/NIH). It contains expression values for ~12.000 proteins for each sample, with missing values present when a given protein could not be quantified in a given sample.    
**Previous Research**: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v534/n7605/full/nature18003.html      
**In short**: They performed K-means clustering on the protein data to divide the breast cancer patients into sub-types, each having unique protein expression signature. They found that the best clustering was achieved using 3 clusters (original PAM50 gene set yields four different subtypes using RNA data).

### Goal
My goal here is to explore this dataset to check if I could reproduce previous research. More importantly, I would like to explore t-sne algorithm in details to visualize how the t-sne seperate different clusters. This is a important tool for Drop-Seq data analysis (http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(15)00549-8) as an early stage to explore the potential molecular mechanisms, which will help me when my thesis project moves forward to the Drop-Seq stage.
