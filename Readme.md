# Bioinformatics

Here is a collections of scripts for Bioinformatics data analysis:

1. Bioinformatics_Data_Skills

   In this folder, I went through all the examples and practice in <Bioinformatics Data Skills> by Vine Buffalo including working with sequence data, range data, alignment data and shell scripting etc.

2. phylogeny

   This is a class project in which I explored the phylogeny tree. 

   From class <Fundamental Models and ALgorithms in Bioinformatics>

3. proteome_analysis

   This is a small personal project to analyze proteome data from breast cancer samples from NCI/NIH.

4. rna_seq_analysis

   This mainly contains some pipeline templates that I used for RNA-Seq data analysis.

5. snps_calling

   This contains some pipeline templates that I may potentially use in my following project.
